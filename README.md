This project is a Python-based time tracker for managing tasks and projects using object-oriented programming (OOP). It allows users to create and manage projects, add tasks to those projects, and track the time spent on each task.

## :black_cat: Features
- **Project Management**: Create and manage multiple projects, each with a unique name.
- **Task Management**: Add tasks to projects, each with a unique identifier (ID) within the project.
- **Time Tracking**: Track the time spent on individual tasks, enabling better time management and productivity analysis.

##  :sunglasses: Class Structure
The application is structured around several key classes:

- **Project**: Represents a project and contains attributes such as:
  - `name`: The unique name of the project.
  - `tasks`: A list of tasks associated with the project.

- **Task**: Represents a task within a project and contains attributes such as:
  - `task_id`: A unique identifier for the task.
  - `description`: A brief description of the task.
  - `time_spent`: Time spent on the task (in hours).

## :ok_hand: Prerequisites
